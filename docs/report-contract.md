# KODA Report Contract

Linux, Windows, CI, and server flows use the shared Python engine. The macOS app
uses the native Swift scanner. Consumers must select the contract for the
artifact they read; the fields below describe findings from shared-engine
`scan --format json` output.

## Finding Fields

Every `scan --format json` finding uses these keys:

| Field | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rule_id` | yes | Stable rule identifier such as `secret.openai-key` or `host.linux.ssh-root-login`. |
| `category` | yes | One of the category values below. |
| `severity` | yes | One of `info`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`. Lowercase only. |
| `title` | yes | Short user-facing finding title. |
| `target` | yes | Logical scan target name. Empty string is allowed when not applicable. |
| `path` | yes | File path when file-backed; host findings may use a relevant system path or an empty path. |
| `line` | yes | 1-based line number or `null`. |
| `evidence` | yes | Redacted evidence. Do not expose raw secrets. |
| `description` | yes | Why this matters. Empty string is allowed. |
| `recommendation` | yes | Remediation guidance. Empty string is allowed. |
| `resource` | yes | Stable host/resource identifier. Empty string for file-backed findings. |
| `reachable` | yes | Empty string, `reachable`, `unreachable`, or `unknown`. |
| `verification_status` | yes | `confirmed`, `needs_review`, or `unverified`. `unverified` means the check could not be evaluated (probe unavailable or blocked); it is an evidence gap, not a risk judgement, and never counts toward scores or gates. Unknown imported values fail closed to `needs_review`. |
| `verification_note` | yes | Reason for the deterministic verification state. Empty string when not needed. |
| `triage_verdict` | yes | Empty string, `likely_true`, `likely_false`, or `uncertain`. |
| `triage_confidence` | yes | Number from 0 to 1, or `null`. |
| `triage_note` | yes | Short triage note. Empty string when not triaged. |
| `analyzer` | yes | Analyzer identity, such as `koda-local` or an approved external analyzer. |
| `analyzer_version` | yes | Analyzer version when known. |
| `analyzer_rule_id` | yes | Original external analyzer rule ID when applicable. |
| `cwe_ids` | yes | CWE identifiers associated with the evidence. Empty array when unavailable. |
| `evidence_kind` | yes | Evidence type, such as `direct` or `dataflow`. |
| `trace` | yes | Ordered evidence trace steps. Empty array when unavailable. |
| `evidence_id` | yes | Stable evidence identifier when assigned. |
| `issue_key` | yes | Stable issue correlation key when assigned. |
| `standard_mappings` | yes | Selected standard/category mappings for the rule. Empty array when unmapped. |

File findings with a line number also include an additive `source_context`
object. Consumers must tolerate additive fields.

## Other JSON artifacts

- `release-package` writes a compact `scan-findings.json` with core finding,
  verification, and analyzer-provenance fields. It does not include
  `target`, `resource`, reachability/AI-triage fields, `standard_mappings`, or
  `source_context`.
- `web-audit` results use the separate 21-control status/coverage/evidence
  contract documented in [WEB_AUDIT.md](security/WEB_AUDIT.md).
- Java archive and SBOM-verification JSON files have workflow-specific schemas;
  use the [Java runbook](security/java-sbom-vulnerability-scan.en.md).

## Categories

Current production categories:

- `secrets`
- `dependencies`
- `configuration`
- `code`
- `prevention`
- `screen_quality`
- `host`

`web` is used by authorized web posture scans and should keep the same finding field shape.

## Platform Rules

- macOS Swift and shared Python implementations may differ internally.
- Shared fields such as `rule_id`, `category`, and `severity` keep the same
  meaning across platform lanes, but artifact-specific schemas are not identical.
- Severity values are lowercase and ordered as: `info`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`.
- CI gates must use `severity`, not localized labels or UI text.
- Report additions should be additive. Do not rename or remove existing keys without a migration.

## Verification

The shared Python serializer is `security_scanner.reporting._finding_payload`.
Run `tests.test_source_analysis`, `tests.test_sw49_standards`, and
`tests.test_settings_and_exports` after changing finding serialization or report
exports.

When changing the macOS Swift scanner output, verify the consumer's actual export
format rather than assuming byte-for-byte parity with shared-engine scan JSON.
