# Security Dashboard Research Notes

The current implementation borrows information architecture from established vulnerability-management tools without copying any vendor branding or proprietary layout.

## Adopted Patterns

- Portfolio view: one dashboard can summarize many local project folders.
- Severity-first triage: critical/high findings are visually prominent.
- Project comparison: targets are listed with finding counts so noisy or risky folders stand out.
- Global filters: severity, category, target, and free-text filtering affect the full dashboard.
- Standard selector: scan requests can narrow local checks by mapped security standards while unsupported standard categories remain visibly unavailable.
- Finding table: remediation guidance stays attached to each finding.
- Interchange output: SARIF is available for downstream static-analysis consumers.
- Code-pattern heuristics: common risky sinks such as dynamic SQL, unsafe HTML rendering, shell execution, path use, SSRF fetches, disabled CSRF/auth checks, unsafe deserialization, file upload saves, request body parsing, and C/C++ buffer APIs can provide lightweight local evidence for standards categories.

## Source-analysis standards

The CLI accepts only IDs registered in `standards.py`. For secure coding and
static evidence, `owasp-asvs-5` is the verification-oriented profile and
`owasp-proactive-controls` is the developer-control profile. OWASP Top 10 and
WSTG remain risk/testing views, not substitutes for a complete language-aware
SAST engine. The Korean profiles are `sw-dev-security-49` (the implementation
weakness controls I-01..I-17, S-01..S-16, T-01..T-02, E-01..E-03, C-01..C-05,
P-01..P-04, A-01..A-02) and `sw-dev-security-7-types` (the seven categories:
input validation and representation, security features, time/state, error
handling, code error, encapsulation, and API misuse). Unsupported or external
categories are rejected instead of being reported as automatically passed.

## Deliberate Limits

- The local risk score is a simple weighted backlog score, not a CVSS calculation.
- Trend charts are not included yet because the scanner does not persist historical scan snapshots.
- SBOM, CVE, EPSS, and advisory lookups are deferred because the first version remains offline and dependency-free.
- Standard selections are mapping profiles over the implemented local rules, not a claim of full standard coverage.
- CWE Top 25 coverage is still heuristic; use-after-free and null-pointer dereference remain unsupported because they need deeper language-aware analysis.
- ISMS-P 2.8 is a supporting-evidence profile, not an ISMS-P audit result; full coverage needs checklist/evidence workflows outside static file scanning.
- ASVS, Proactive Controls, and the Korean profiles are mapping profiles over
  the implemented local rules; formal compliance still requires the standard's
  design, test, runtime, and organizational evidence.
