## Branch And Review Protection

- [ ] Protect the default branch.
- [ ] Require pull requests before merge.
- [ ] Require at least one approving review.
- [ ] Require status checks for KODA/SAST tests before merge.
- [ ] Require review from CODEOWNERS for security-sensitive paths.
- [ ] Dismiss stale approvals when new commits are pushed.

## Secret And Dependency Protection

- [ ] Enable secret scanning and push protection.
- [ ] Enable Dependabot alerts.
- [ ] Enable Dependabot security updates.
- [ ] Upload SARIF results from KODA, CodeQL, Semgrep, or equivalent tools.
- [ ] Keep Actions token permissions read-only by default.

## Accountability

- [ ] Add `.github/CODEOWNERS`.
- [ ] Define a vulnerability reporting contact in `SECURITY.md`.
- [ ] Review exceptions in `koda-ignore.yml` on a schedule.
- [ ] Track SBOM and VEX artifacts for releases.

## Prepare The Organization

- [ ] Define secure-development roles and owners.
- [ ] Keep `SECURITY.md`, CODEOWNERS, and exception policy current.
- [ ] Train contributors on secrets, dependency hygiene, and secure defaults.

## Protect The Software

- [ ] Keep source access least-privilege.
- [ ] Block secrets and high-risk findings before commit.
- [ ] Generate SBOMs for release builds.
- [ ] Sign release artifacts and preserve provenance.

## Produce Well-Secured Software

- [ ] Run KODA, SAST, and dependency checks on pull requests.
- [ ] Use secure defaults for configuration, cookies, CORS, containers, and CI tokens.
- [ ] Keep dependency update automation enabled.
- [ ] Review design changes for auth, data protection, and trust boundaries.

## Respond To Vulnerabilities

- [ ] Triage OSV/CVE findings with KEV/EPSS context.
- [ ] Record reviewed dependency findings in VEX.
- [ ] Track remediation owner, due date, and release note/advisory.
- [ ] Re-run KODA and compare score history after remediation.

This checklist turns CISA Secure by Design principles into project-level prevention work that KODA can help track.

## Take Ownership Of Customer Security Outcomes

- [ ] Treat exposed secrets, unsafe defaults, and known exploited vulnerabilities as customer-impacting defects.
- [ ] Provide secure defaults for auth, sessions, logging, CORS, and deployment configuration.
- [ ] Ship updates or compensating guidance quickly for exploitable dependency findings.
- [ ] Keep a security contact and vulnerability handling process visible.

## Embrace Radical Transparency And Accountability

- [ ] Publish security policy, supported versions, and remediation expectations.
- [ ] Keep SBOM and VEX artifacts for releases.
- [ ] Record known limitations, accepted risks, and exception expiry dates.
- [ ] Track score history and severity deltas after each release.

## Lead From The Top

- [ ] Assign owners for product security outcomes.
- [ ] Review Secure by Design metrics regularly: high findings, time to remediate, secrets blocked, and vulnerable dependencies.
- [ ] Require security gates before merge and release.
- [ ] Invest in prevention automation instead of relying only on post-release fixes.

Use VEX to record reviewed dependency vulnerabilities after OSV, Dependency-Track, or another advisory source reports a CVE.

- the vulnerability or CVE ID
- status such as `not_affected`, `affected`, `fixed`, or `under_investigation`
- impact statement and expiry/review date

KODA treats VEX as a prevention artifact. It does not claim a vulnerability is safe automatically; it only checks that review decisions can be tracked.

For release builds, add provenance and signing controls before publishing artifacts:

1. Build release artifacts in CI, not on a developer laptop.
2. Generate SLSA provenance or an equivalent attestation.
3. Sign artifacts with Sigstore/cosign or your organization's signing system.
4. Publish checksums, signatures, and provenance next to the release.
5. Keep GitHub Actions permissions read-only by default and grant write or OIDC permissions only at job scope.

KODA detects missing signing/provenance preparation from local workflow files, but actual signature verification requires the built artifact and release metadata.
