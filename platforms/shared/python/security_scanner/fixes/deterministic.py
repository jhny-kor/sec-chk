"""Deterministic, line-scoped fixers.

Each fixer takes a single source line and returns the corrected line, or ``None`` when it
has nothing safe to change. Fixes are intentionally conservative and idempotent: they only
rewrite forms with an unambiguous safe equivalent, leaving anything uncertain untouched so
the user can fix it manually. The dry-run diff and ``--apply`` approval gate in ``apply.py``
are the safety net around these.
